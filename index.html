We are going to make shopping cart feature a part of our system as it is the most important part. This option is highly important for any e-commerce website, however, it lets the users choose products and review their selections. Our ride started by just fitting the foundation of the website using HTML for giving it the structure and CSS for it to be stylish. Next, we will deal with the more advanced features of the platform using JS.


We did JavaScript to add a functionality to the cart that would enable the selection of products by clicking one button. Every single thing that is on the website has an "Add to Cart" button. When clicked, a Java script function becomes active adding the product onto the shopping cart array and invoking the cart display panel to update the quantity of the item. This function is designed to:This function is designed to:

1. Check whether it's already added to the cart.

2. More of the product can be put into the cart if there is only this product in the cart at the moment.

3. In case the product you are looking for is not in cart, just click and add to the cart.

4. Count and display the cost the customer will have to pay on the very spot at each time he selects or deletes something.



The cart style of the site was made to be not only functional but also to look good through the use of CSS. We therefore made the cart be seen in every page so as to make navigation easy and the shopping experience smooth but not at all frustrating. We add responsive design elements to make the cart and website work on any device and with all types of screens.



Such a project opened our minds to the fact the client side scripting with JavaScript is powerful in that it is able to do on user interaction without involving the server side programming. We mastered the ways of handling and playing upon DOM and how to store data in a local browser location. Besides us we gained awareness of making a responsive web design that designed out as per different screen sizes of devices.
